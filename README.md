# Stanford Dogs Classifier Performance Analysis

This repository is dedicated to analyzing the performance of a multi-class image classifier on the Stanford Dogs dataset. It provides insights into how well the classifier performs across different dog breeds. There are two main modules designed for this analysis:

## 1. Confusion Matrix

The Confusion Matrix module offers a visual representation of the classifier's performance. It helps us understand how the model's predictions compare to the actual labels for various dog breeds.

#### 1. Matrix Table

The Matrix Table is a straightforward representation of the confusion matrix. It displays the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives for each dog breed.

#### 2. Heatmap

The Heatmap is a graphical representation of the confusion matrix. It uses color to visualize patterns in the classifier's performance. Additionally, it includes an overlay to highlight areas with false positives, providing a more comprehensive view of classification errors.

These modules aim to provide a clear and detailed analysis of the Stanford Dogs classifier's performance, enabling us to evaluate its strengths and weaknesses in breed classification.
